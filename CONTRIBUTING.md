# Contributing to Kanagawa for zathura

Thanks for helping. This port follows the
[Kanagawa community contributing guide](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md),
which explains conventional commits, the checks every pull request runs, and how
changes are reviewed. This page covers only what is specific to this port.

## Where to report what

- Problems with the theme in zathura, such as wrong colors, poor
  contrast, or a missing variant, belong in this repository's
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/zathura/issues).
- Problems in zathura itself belong with its maintainers, not here. Start
  from the [application's page](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/).
- Changes to the colors themselves belong in the
  [shared palette](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/blob/main/docs/PALETTE.md),
  not in this port. Open an issue in the
  [.github repository](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/issues)
  so every port stays in step.

## Colors

Take colors from the shared [palette](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/blob/main/docs/PALETTE.md)
and follow the [style guide](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/blob/main/docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md).
Do not sample colors from screenshots or add new ones. Every change must work in
Wave, Dragon, and Lotus.

To read the colors from a script, use the machine-readable
[palette.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kanagawa-community/.github/main/palette.json).

## Working on this port

`scripts/generate.py` writes the themes in `themes/` from the shared palette by
role. Do not edit a color value in a theme file. To change a theme:

1. Change the role mapping in `scripts/generate.py`.
2. Run `scripts/generate.py`.
3. Commit its output.

CI fails if a committed theme differs from the generator output. To try a change,
run `./install.sh`, then include the theme in `zathurarc`.

The images in `assets/` are screenshots of real zathura windows, taken in a
headless session, so no window opens on your screen. After changing a theme, run
this from the repository root and commit the new images:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kanagawa-community/.github/main/scripts/capture-windows.sh)
```

It fetches the shared capture scripts from the
[.github repository](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github).
`scripts/window.sh` holds the part for this port and needs zathura with a PDF plugin, rsvg-convert. See the
[preview standard](https://github.com/kanagawa-community/.github/blob/main/docs/PREVIEWS.md#capturing-application-windows)
for the rest.
